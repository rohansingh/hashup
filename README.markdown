hashup
======

hashup uses file hashes to reduce bandwidth usage by skipping the upload of a
large file if the file has been previously uploaded to the server. It uses HTML5 
web workers to preserve UI performance, and HMAC's (hash-based message
authentication codes) to preserve file security and prevent information leakage.
